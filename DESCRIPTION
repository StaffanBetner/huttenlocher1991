Description: 
    Provides vocabulary growth dataset from Huttenlocher et al. (1991)
    <https://doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.27.2.236>. This dataset is useful 
    educationally because it features longitudinal/repeated measures growth 
    data. It is also unusual because the only fixed effect predictor is 
    quadratic time--that is, there is no intercept or linear time terms.
